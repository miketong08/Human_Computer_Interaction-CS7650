## Abstract:
The interface of Outlook could be improved, especially from a student perspective. As the default emailing interface for students at GT the general use of the interface is to send and respond to emails, but why does it appear and feel as if it does not emphasize these tasks?

It's 0600 EST on a Monday that your paper is due, and you need to email your amazingly responsive professor regarding clarification on a question before you submit it thorugh Canvas. You log into Outlook, and you're immediately greeted with an interface of colorful icons, front and center, a list of emails with the iconic calendar button and a giant "Select an item to read" button; the dark contrasting bar at top then grabs your attention with relatable icons for apps, skype, alerts, settings and questions; the botton left has another contrasting bar with icons for email, calendar, groups, and tasks. It's early, you're used to Gmail, you click the two buttons that look like an option for emailing someone, the giant mail icon front and center. Feedback? Null, it appears to do nothing. Your eyes then seek the next email icon, above the Indox, a button that says "New" with a mail icon to the right of it. You click the icon. Feedback? Your 420 emails from "Weekly Digest" and "Melissa Moore" are marked as read. As the caffine sinks in, you remember that the mathematical "XOR" button is used to create a new email. Disgruntled, but not defeated, you finally create a new email, and quickly realize the new email column is cut off because it's not optimized for split-screening, and the column is appended to the right. Small oversight you think, and open it as a full window. You write your question in the email, and begin to type your professor's name in the "To" address. You decide that it's a good idea to also include your TA, and go to CC them. As you type their name, it doesn't appear, and you realize that you've never emailed them in the past. Now you go to back to Canvas to find their email address, and copy and past it into the CC address.

Here lies just some of the issues surrounding Outlook. Why is an interface created to create, read, and respond to emails so convoluted? Especially as a default application for a Georgia Tech (GT) student, why is it not adjusted to complement the needs of them?
