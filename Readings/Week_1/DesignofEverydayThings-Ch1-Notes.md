# Design of Everyday Things Ch1:
## The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
---
* __Industrial design__: Creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value and appearance of products and systems.
* __Interaction design__: The focus on how people interact with technology. Goal is to enhance people's understanding of what is happening and what has just occured.
* __Experience design__: Design products, processes, services, events, and environments to focus on the quality of enjoyment.

_“You are designing for people the way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.”_ (Pg-7)

HCD: An approach that puts human needs, capabilities and behavior first, then design to accommodate those needs capabilities and ways of behaving.

#### Affordances:
Characteristics of an object and their relationship to a agent. Affordance depends on the properties of both the object and agent.
*A chair __affords__ (is for) support, and therefore affords sitting.*

__Gibsonian psychology__: An approac to perception, stating that the world contained clues that required agents to pick them up through "direct perception". "Information pickup" does not require the brain's internal processing, it is processed via other sensory apparatus's.

Perceived affordances aid in gifuring out what actions are possible, without the need for additional labels or instructions. Signaling components for affordances are *signifiers*.

---
#### Signifiers:
Any perceivable indicator (eg. mark or sound) that communicates appropriate behavior to an agent.

Affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where the action should take place.

Accidental affordances can be strong signifiers for future behavior.

---
#### Mappings:
The relationship between elements of two sets of things (eg. the connection between a switch and light).

Examples include automotive controls, or nautral hand gestures such as moving a hand up to signify more.

Grouping and proximity and important principles from Gestalt psychology for mapping controls to function: related controls should be near eachother, and they should all be near the item being controlled.

Cultural differences also need to be considered, as they affect the feeling of "nautral" controls.

A device is easy to use when the set of possible actions are visable, and the control and displays exploit natural mappings.

---
#### Feedback:
The communication of results of an action.

Poor feedback results in poor communication of information (eg. a light flashe to indicate something occured, but no additional information). May result in adverse effects of irritation or anxiety.

Too much feedback can also be unproductive (eg. a backseat driver, too much information, even if some of it is valid. Too many announcements can cause ignorance).

Actions need to be confirmed, but in a manner that is unobstrusive. They also need to be prioritized, so as not to be overwhelmingly ignored.

---
#### Conceptual Models:
An explaination, usually highly simplified, of how something works. Simplified models are valuable if certain assumpts are held true.

Conceptual models that this book is concerned about are "*mental models*", which represent an individuals undersatnding of how certain things work. Obviously, different conceptual models exist for different people, and maybe even different environments.

Conceptual models are often inferred from the device itself, and often times from manuals. Usually, the device offers little assistance, so models are constructed from experience.

A good conceptual model guides the user when things go wrong.

---
#### The System Image:
The information available to an agent about the product, process, service, or event. This includes non-tangible information such as tribal knowledge of similar models.

The user's conceptual model comes from the system image, through interaction with the product, reading, searching for online information, reading the manual, etc. Often, the designer cannot communicate directly with the user, and the system image acts as an indirect means to information transfer.

A good system image can aid the agent in the development of a good conceptual model.

---
#### The Paradox of Technology:
Technology inherently becomes more complex, and while its goal is to simplify our lives, it often incorporates more functions, and thus requires that the agent be proactivtive to learn how to use them. While productive if used correctly, it may cause frustration if its functionality is not articulated correctly (eg. poor signifiers, feedbak, conceptual model adaption, system image).

---
#### The Design Challenge:
Great design requires multiple discipline, great designers, and great management.

Often each discipline is bias towards their direct contributions.

Everyone in the pipieline (producers, retailers, consumers, etc) has their own demands.
