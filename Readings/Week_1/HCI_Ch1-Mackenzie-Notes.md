## Introudction and History

*ACM*: Association for Computing Machinery

Potential reading: "As We May Think" (Bush, 1945)

*Memex*: Term coined by Bush to describe an indexing scheme where points on interest are interconnected.

Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad - First "direct manipulation" tool for HCI (1962)
> Direct manipulation in the sense that: Object is visible, incremental actions are possible, rapid feedback, reversibility, exploration, syntactic correctness, and replacing language with action.

Douglas Engelbart - Computer Mouse (1963)
First empirical HCI user study was to compare different input devices, the light pen, joystick, knee-controlled lever, Grafacon, and mouse.

*Counterbalancing*: Changing the order of test administration.

*"When a metaphor is present, the user has a jump-start on knowing what to do. The user exploits existing knowledge from another domain"*

Usability = Invisibility

Event-driven programming vs sequential programming:

The birth of HCI, 1983: First ACM SIGCHI conference, Publication of *The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction*, and the arrival of the Apple Macintosh (technically 1984).

*Model human processor* (MHP), from Card, Moran, and Newell's book.
* Eye and ear for sensory input.
* Brain for cognitive processing.
* Arm, hand, finger for motor response.

Newell:
> *By the time such a concrete system exists, most of the important degrees of freedom in the interface have been bounded. What is needed are tools for thought for the designer - so at design time the properties and constraints of the user can be brought to bear in making the important choices.*
* Experimentation cannot be done until it is usually too late (bounding of degrees of freedom).

Nominal prediction of reaction time as a function of *primitive actions* for the *fastman* and *slowman* predictions (from *Keystroke-level* model (Card):

Reaction time = $t_p + 2 \times t_c + t_M$
* $t_p$ is the perceptual processrr cycle
* $t_c$ is the cognitive processor cycle
* $t_m$ is the motor processor cycle
Nominal = $100[30\sim  200] + 2*(70[25\sim  170]) + 70[30\sim 100]$
= $310[130\sim 640]$ms
